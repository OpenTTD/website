Buffer overflow in the TruncateString function allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
crafted string.

To trigger this bug a custom language file is needed that is large enough to
exceed the size of the buffer. No released version of OpenTTD has had strings
nearly long enough to trigger this.
