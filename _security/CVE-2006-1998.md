Both client and server handle a type of command (PACKET_SERVER_ERROR
and PACKET_CLIENT_ERROR) for the visualization of some pre-built errors
in the console.
The problem happens when an attacker sends an invalid big error number
(8 bit) which forces the program to terminate spontaneously through the
usage of the error() function.
The bug is exploitable only in-game so the attacker must have access to
the server: his IP must not be banned, he must know the password if it
has been set and the server must not be full.
