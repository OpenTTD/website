Ho ho ho!
<br/><br/>
The task of the day is to deliver millions of packets. This needs for sure a properly planned network.
To give a figure: Santa spends 364 days per year playing OpenTTD to stay in shape for delivering things.
<br/><br/>
Inbetween the packets Santa even dropped a beta release for the upcoming OpenTTD 1.3!
This version delivers a lot of improvements to the usability and interface, especially to the configuration
settings, which have grown the past years like Santa's beard :o
<br/><br/>
Also under the hood there are new features for NewGRFs and Game Scripts. So, make sure to check out the new
add-ons which become available when using a 1.3 version.
