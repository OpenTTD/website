title: Future of the Mac OS X port
author: Rubidium

We are currently seriously reconsidering support for the Mac OS X port.
<br/><br/>
While most of the Mac OS X users know about Apple's new Mac OS X version 'Snow Leopard', only a few will know that OpenTTD does not officially support that version of Mac OS X. Without anyone capable enough to continue support for the Mac OS X port we will stop officially supporting the Mac OS X port completely at the 1.0 major release.
<br/><br/>
We would like to ask whether there is anyone capable enough to continue the Mac OS X port.
<br/><br/>
