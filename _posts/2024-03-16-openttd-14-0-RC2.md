Today we release 14.0-RC2, the second release candidate for the upcoming release.
We've fixed a whole bunch of issues found in the first release candidate.
However, there is a good chance there are still some issues out there that haven't been found yet.
Please help us hunt those down, and if you find one, you can [report them here](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose).

Translation updates are coming in every day, most languages are complete or are nearing completion. 
If you are a translator, please see if [your language has any missing translations](https://translator.openttd.org/project/openttd-master).
We greatly appreciate your contribution!
