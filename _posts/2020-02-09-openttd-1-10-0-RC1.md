We managed to make quite a lot of changes in RC1, which marks the beginning of the "feature freeze" phase of the 1.10 release cycle.

This release comes with a final flurry of features including a new screenshot window and type, several NewGRF & Script additions and more.
Some notable changes are a new improved algorithm for transfer networks and improved sharing of industry production output between multiple stations.
Also many (mostly obscure) crashing bugs were ousted.

See the changelog for further details.
