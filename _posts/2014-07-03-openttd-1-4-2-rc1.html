The hunt for bugs in OpenTTD 1.4 continues. Today you can get your hands on the first release candidate for 1.4.2.
<br/><br/>
Most noticeable it works around issues with very recent versions of OSX resp. its video drivers; but it also makes games with multiple thousands of stations work again.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">OpenTTD 1.4.2-RC1</a> and report issues to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/index.php?project=1&type[]=1&do=index">bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
Thanks, and have fun!
