title: DNS outage and other tidbits

As you could see everything related to OpenTTD was out for a few days (at least the DNS servers which are responsible for ip-to-address resolve). Due to a power-out the servers were shut down and wouldn't reboot properly. Of course this happened during the weekend, so we had to wait until Monday to get it fixed.
Everything is back online now :).<p>
On another note, an RSS button has been added to the website for the people that like RSS-feed of the sparse news openttd.org supplies.<p>
Once a few issues are resolved you can expect a new release in the near future. Until then we strongly recommend to try out the nightlies (<a href="https://www.openttd.org/en/download-stable">Downloads section</a>) if you can't wait.
