<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a> might have decided to go for a <a href=http://www.thebreakfast.info/forum/archive/index.php/t-5876.html>less reckless speed</a>, 
thus visited some places early and also dropped a parcel with OpenTTD 1.1.4. While it may not be exactly on time, the bright side is
 that you'll have it one day early ;-). 
</p><p>
Compared to the RC this new release brings you again less crashes, fixes a nasty memory bug and improves handling of ships near locks.
 As usual you can get the release from <a href=http://www.openttd.org/download-stable>our website</a>, bugs, as usual, go to our 
<a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.

Happy Sinterklaas!</p>
