<p>Let us present: the first release candidate for the upcoming OpenTTD 1.1.0. Next to a few new features like a minimal industry density setting or a much improved UI of the console by allowing mouse scrolling there, a well-sized list of bugs has been addressed since the last beta release, among them a number of bugs which crashed OpenTTD under certain conditions. See the full changelog <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.1.0-RC1/changelog.txt">here</a>.
</p><p>
Please test this <a href="http://www.openttd.org/en/download-testing">release candidate</a> and report any bugs and problems you encounter with it in our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a> in order to help us improve the game further and make sure the final release for 1.1.0 will even be better and more stable.

Enjoy!
