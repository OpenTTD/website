title: OpenTTD 0.4.7

OpenTTD 0.4.7 is a hotfix for the previous release. In this a nasty bug has crept, due to improper testing, that prevented the pathfinder (NPF) to work correctly. This greatly set back the gaming-experience so it was decided to do another release than to have you suffer from this.<br>
<i>"You can safely upgrade from 0.4.5 to this version as hopefully nothing has gotten broken, only fixed."</i> <- I can confirm this though making it valid for 0.4.7.
<p>
As usual, you can find the release on SourceForge. There is also a forum post to spill your feelings, and a scenario package that you might want to use with the source files.<br>
