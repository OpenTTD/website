Did you know that the savegame which plays behind the main menu of OpenTTD is created and selected by the community?

As we approach the release of OpenTTD 1.11.0, it's time to select the next title screen. Entries were open for four weeks on [TT-Forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=88509) and we received five entries from Erato, Timberwolf, didac, Emperor Jake, and Chrnan6710.

To vote, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenTTD/title-screen-competition-1.11/discussions/3). You'll need a GitHub account (free). The deadline is Sunday, March 28, 2021, at 23:59:00 UTC.
