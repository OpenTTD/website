A short horror story: "I felt like a shiver along my spine, that is OTTD 1.10.3 coming like an unexpected train". 

Fix o'clock!

Several fixes, most notably a crashing bug to do with group creation and renaming that that we had several crash reports for, and a potential desync with subsidy creation.

More details in the changelog below. Have fun!
