<p>Last weekend OpenTTD migrated its source (Subversion) and bugs (FlySpray) to GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD">https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD</a>).<br>This change was long overdue and we are happy we finally did it.<p>

<p>What changed for you? (biggest changes)</p>

<ul>
 <li> Issues now on <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues">https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues</a></li>
 <li> Source now on <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD">https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD</a></li>
 <li> Patches you have can be posted on <br><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pulls">https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pulls</a></li>
 <li> Big cleanup of issues and patches</li>
 <li> Rework of how we create binaries; soon(tm) we can easier produce binaries for forks, including Patchpacks.</li>
</ul>
