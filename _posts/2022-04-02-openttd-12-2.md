We tried to release OpenTTD 13 on April 1st, but supply chain issues are affecting new feature production and forced us to delay the release.

To compensate, we swept the factory floor for bits and pieces that where left around and could be repurposed.
We found enough to be able to produce a 12.2 maintenance release for you.
