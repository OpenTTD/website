The first quarter of 2013 is over, so it's time for the first release of the 1.3 series.
If you are tired of hopping around and hiding chocolate eggs everywhere, this might be your chance to relax with building some tracks.
<br/><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">download page</a> you will also find the complete change log, listing all features, changes and fixes since 1.2.3.
If you haven't followed the beta and RC stages, you should take a look at the new game scripts and NewGRF via the in-game content download, which become available when using 1.3.0.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to all testers involved during the alpha and beta. If you didn't help testing, and now find a bug... well, I guess you are still allowed to report it to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bug tracker</a> :)
<br/><br/>
Have Fun and Good Game!
