There has been an error in the Debian 0.5.2 packages, that made them uninstallable. The error has been fixed and new packages are now available on the <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>download page</a>. This only applies to packages downloaded manually from here, packages retrieved by apt are fine.
