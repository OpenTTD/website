The mountains should now be glitch-free, so they are safe to conquer by train, road vehicle, aircraft, and even by ship! In addition, improvements were made to zoomed guis, for more fun at the high resolution screens.
<br/>
There are other features and fixes too, for the full log, see the <a href="http://hg.openttd.org/openttd/trunk.hg/raw-file/53f10edbd7f1/changelog.txt">changelog</a>. If you are more interested in playing, <a href="http://www.openttd.org/en/download-testing">download here</a>.
<br/><br/>
The new beta is just perfect for checking out the results of the title game competition, after <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=1143165#p1143165">looking at the screenshots and sending in your votes</a>.

Have fun climbing the mountains,
