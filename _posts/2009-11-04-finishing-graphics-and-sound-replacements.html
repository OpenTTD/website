title: Finishing graphics and sound replacements
author: Rubidium

Over the last years people have been working on a free replacement set for the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sounds so OpenTTD can be played without you having to have Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
<br /><br />
Great input has been given for both <a href="http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx">OpenGFX</a>, the graphics replacement set which is 98% finished and still needs 208 sprites, and <a href="http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx">OpenSFX</a>, the sound replacement set which is 83% finished and still needs 12 sound samples. With your input we hope that we can finish both of these projects before the next major release so we can include them in the packaging/documentation and thus make the first truely free OpenTTD.
<br /><br />
So, can you draw, mix sounds or record sounds? This is the way to donate to the project so we can meet our objectives.
