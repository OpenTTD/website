It's autumn in the north, and it's release time!
To provide you with the best playing experience throughout the dark cold nights in the next months, we are preparing a new bug fix release.
(If you are on the southern hemisphere, just go swimming or so :s )
<br/><br/>
The first release candidate for 1.1.4 provides fixes for bugs in various areas: NewGRF support, NoAI, GUI and savegame compatibility.
Please help testing it, and report the bugs you encounter to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bugtracker</a>.
You can find the binaries in the usual spot on our <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">download sites</a>.
<br/><br/>
Have fun!
