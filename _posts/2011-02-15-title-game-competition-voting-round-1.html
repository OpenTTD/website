<p>Submissions for our title game competitions are closed as of now and we received with 34 submissions quite a lot and very nice savegames for use of the title game with the OpenTTD 1.1 series.
</p><p>
<a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/">The poll is open now</a>. The designation of winning entries will be done in two steps, two voting rounds. The first voting round starts now and lasts till March 1st and the result will be a shortlist of three savegames. Everyone may vote once and nominate and rank his or her top three entries. The favourite one will get 3 points, the 2nd ranked one two and the 3rd ranked one one point. Upon closure of polls, the results will be published in detail. Votes are cast by <a href="mailto:planetmaker@openttd.org?subject=Titlegame Round 1&body=My three nominations for the final voting round are:%0A%0A1st choice (3pt): %0A2nd choice (2pt):%0A3rd choice (1pt):">sending me an e-mail</a> with your ranking list of the top three savegames; use the suppied link here or on the titlegame page for a read-prepared e-mail.

The top three in cumulated points from all votes will constitute the short list for the subsequent 2nd round of votes which will then only have one winner.
