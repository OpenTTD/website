Here it is, the mandatory bugfix release.

Some server administrators complained about us breaking the admin port protocol.
Sorry about that, we're bringing the old protocol back now, your old tools will now work again.

Someone also found two crash bugs to fix, game script goal question id's being truncated, and a display issue when refitting incredibly large trains.
You people have way too much creativity, who would ever think of building a ship depot next to a dock?

Enjoy!
