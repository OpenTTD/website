<p>A lazy weekend passed for some (like me), but others were busy gathering the bug fixes of the last weeks and made them available in the 1.0 branch, including fixes for some nasty crashes and annoying GUI glitches. So maybe you feel like testing our newest release candidate, 1.0.5-RC1 and help to make sure that the upcoming stable 1.0.5 really deserves the attribute 'stable'. Should you find any bugs, please report them to our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Downloads of the new 1.0.5-RC1 release are available as usual from the link on the top left of this page.</p>
