<p>In the last years we had a competition for a titlegame to be shipped with the stable releases - and we'd like to do the same with the releases of the 1.5 series.
</p><p>
I'd like to invite all interested parties to create a nice savegame which makes a good showcase for and a nice introduction to OpenTTD.

Deadline for submissions is 22nd February 2015, 0:00:00h UTC. For all details please, including submission guides and voting procedure, see our forum thread <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=72617">this forum thread</a>. In short: use only unmodified OpenTTD without any NewGRFs, AIs or GameScripts.
</p><p>
We are looking forward to your titlegame submissions!</p>
