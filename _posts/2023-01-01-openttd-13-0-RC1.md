Well, we didn't manage to get 13.0 out for Christmas, nor did we get it done for New Year either.
Too much drinking and merriment, no doubt.
However we have managed to get to release candidate stage so the features for 13.0 are now frozen.

The last major feature to squeeze its way in is a new method of providing "variant" NewGRF vehicles which should prove more accessible than refit types.
Additionally a boat load of bug fixes (quite a lot to do with the new interface scaling feature).

Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up and report any issues as normal!
