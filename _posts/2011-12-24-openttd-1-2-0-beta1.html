<p>It's Christmas, so let us give you a nice present: <a href=http://www.openttd.org/en/download-testing>OpenTTD 1.2.0-beta1</a>.
</p><p>
This release is the first testing release in the upcoming 1.2 series of OpenTTD.
It has as usual a wide range of new features new to this series:
</p><p>
Notably, NewGRF support has been improved tremendously, though that will often
need support by the NewGRFs themselves: refit for vehicles in stations, much
easier to make ground aware houses, industries, airports and objects, range
limitation for planes. Also NewGRFs now can display readme, changelog and 
license information ingame via convenient buttons from the NewGRF dialogue and
can link to their Website which will open it in your favourite browser. NewGRF
authors may want to check out the specs and changelog for NewGRF v8.
</p><p>
But NewGRFs of course is not all: OpenTTD now supports game scripts capable to
define goals, tutorials and similar. They can be implemented in a very similar
way to current AIs.
</p><p>
That's still not all: You'll probably immediately notice: you can now zoom-in
2x and 4x compared to previous releases; that'll allow you to enjoy the game
better on displays with high pixel densities.
</p><p>
And there's a lot of more things like rivers are now generated during map
creation or you can opt to enable maintenance costs for your property which
allows to counter a bit the linear money increase as costs for property
increase more than linear with the amount of property which needs maintenance.
For full list of changes see our <a href=http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.2.0-beta1/changelog.txt>changelog</a>.
</p><p>
As this is a testing release, we like to ask you to give it a thorough test,
both new features and 'old stuff' as well. Please help us in making the final
release of OpenTTD as bug-free as possible by reporting any glitches and bugs
you may encounter in our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.
</p><p>
Also note that there's a running <a href=http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/round1/index.html>title game competition</a> for this release branch. You may consider to participate, create and submit your vanilla game best suited for this contest.
</p><p>
Enjoy, merry Christmas and happy new year,<br>
Your OpenTTD team
