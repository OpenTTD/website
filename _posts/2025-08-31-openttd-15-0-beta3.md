Did you have a lazy summer? Over at OpenTTD HQ, we did not!

We've continued to make improvements to OpenTTD, both very visible to player and under the hood. It's time for another beta so you can help us test. Highlights include:
* Bridges can now be built over stations (NewGRF stations must be updated to support this)
* [NewGRF] Bridge GRFs can now have pillar information, so that a pillar can be skipped if it obstructs the tile below (rail, road, or station)
* Ships traveling in opposite directions try not to drive on the same line of tiles
* Purchase and picker menus can now be filtered using NewGRF Badges
* Settings and Options menus have been merged
* Scenario Editor has improvements for placing and expanding towns
  * New buttons to expand town roads and buildings separately
  * "Many random towns" button now prompts for the number of towns
* Picker window sprite previews can be increased in height, so you can see the entire skyscraper in the house picker (for example)
* The Infrastructure list window now has a scrollbar
* A variety of bugfixes

(As always, see the changelog for further details).
