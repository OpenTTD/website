Many bugs got squashed due to your testing of the stable release. Now it has become time to release a new test version, namely 1.3.2-RC1.
Download is at the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">usual place</a>. The <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.3.2-RC1/changelog.txt">changelog</a> shows all the fixes that were done, including adding support for two new languages.
<br/><br/>
The new languages required a rewrite of all string rendering code, so it's possible that it's not working optimal in all cases. Please look out for text that suddenly looks different, as it might indicate a bug.
<br/><br/>
Should you stumble over any bugs or issues that we forgot to fix, please <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">report them</a>.
<br/><br/>
Enjoy and happy test-building!
<br/>
Your OpenTTD team
