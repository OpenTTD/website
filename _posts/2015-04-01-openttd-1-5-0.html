It's the time of the year where everybody does a little crazy, and much like every year, we join the fun.
<br/><br/>
This year, we release the 1.5.0 stable release, with higher mountains than you have ever seen before, a better UI for high resolution screens, and a much more rural intro screen.
<br/>
There are many other changes and fixes, see the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.5.0/changelog.txt">changelog</a> for the full list.
<br/><br/>
To play at heights unseen, download the new binary from the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">usual place</a>.
