Today we want to raise your attention to an external project.
<br/><br/>
Pikka - one of the long-standing artists around OpenTTD, who has released nummerous NewGRF - considers working
full-time for 9 months on a graphics project for OpenTTD.
To make this possible he has started a
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1512547915/pineapple-graphics-for-openttd">kick starter</a> to raise funds for his life expenses.
<br/><br/>
We don't know whether you like the art-style, or whether new graphics to OpenTTD are worth your money,
but we can at least tell you that it is a trustworthy project with decent conditions.
<br/><br/>
