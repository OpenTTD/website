Come chat with us about OpenTTD! We held [our first Twitch livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrVa-MQjbDk) late last year (you may have heard rumors of hovercraft shenanigans, [which we deny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghUEXPdqonI)), and will host another on April 2nd. Tune in at 18:00 UTC on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/openttdlive/about) â€” here's a handy [countdown and time zone converter](https://a.chronus.eu/19B5298).

Live to chat about NewGRF and OpenTTD development will be 2TallTyler, andythenorth, frosch, and Timberwolf, with TrueBrain behind the scenes to run the stream and ask us your questions posted in the chat. We hope you'll join us!
