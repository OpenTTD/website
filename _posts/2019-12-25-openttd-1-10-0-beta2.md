Hope everyone's having a merry winter festival!

We at the OpenTTD offices are celebrating the season with continuing to progress
towards the stable release of 1.10. As such, 1.10.0-beta2 is now published.

Nothing too ground breaking in this beta release, with some usability
improvements and many crash fixes.

See the changelog for further details.
