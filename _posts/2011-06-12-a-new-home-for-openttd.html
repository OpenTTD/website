title: A new home for OpenTTD
author: planetmaker

Some may or may not have noticed a slightly slower behaviour of our web services the last days
or found in <a href="http://irc.openttdcoop.org/?channels=openttd&uio=d4">IRC</a> the announcement
that the server is subject to increased I/O operations. The reason behind this behaviour is
simple: OpenTTD (and along with it also OpenDune and TTDpatch binaries) move to a new home which
is now graciously sponsored by <a href="http://www.ovh.de">OVH</a> and these I/O operations were
mostly copying stuff from our old server to the new machine. At the same time we would like to thank
<a href="http://www.leaseweb.nl">LeaseWeb</a> for being our host for the last years.

Especially TrueBrain has been and still is working hard the last days to transition
all our services to the new and much more powerful machine. On the surface you won't see much difference
except that now of course the sponsor's logo changed. Behind the scenes the transition from the old
machine to the new still goes on. Thus please bear with us and tell us if there are issues with one of
our services.
