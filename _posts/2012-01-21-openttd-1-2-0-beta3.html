It's already time for the third beta release. We present you with OpenTTD 1.2.0-beta3. Several bugs were fixed in NewGRF handling, including a desync.
<br/><br/>
The game scripts were also further developed, and Zuu made a nice tutorial that needs testing (downloadable from the BaNaNaS online content service) for the benefit of our new players.
<br/><br/>
You can find the new release at the <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">download page</a>, where you can also find a link to the changelog.
Give the new release a good workout, and report any bugs that you find at our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">bug tracker</a>.
