OpenTTD 1.9.0 is now published.

After extensive testing and much feedback on the new feature for 16 cargos in and out of industries, we reached the conclusion that the economy is simply too complex.
For this reason, all cargo types have been removed from the game, and been replaced with a single 'Stuff'.
The new freedom offered by this will for the first time in history let you genuinely build the transportation empire of your dreams.
