Today we updated <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-useful-releases/latest.html">openttd-useful.zip</a> to fix some linking issues with the nightlies/trunk. We also updated the freetype and png libraries.<br />
If you do not compile OpenTTD yourself or you are not using Microsoft's compiler you will not be affected.
