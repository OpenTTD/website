After a long travel through various betas and RCs we finally arrived: Today we released OpenTTD 1.1.0, the new stable version!
<br/><br/>
Though there was a bit of stumbling involved in the stabilisation process around RC1 and RC2,
there was only need for one single fix after RC3. So, enjoy stableness!
Alternatively you could enjoy lavishing us with bug reports for 1.1.0 and force a soon 1.1.1 :p
<br/><br/>
Also note, that this release is again available for Mac OSX, and also the Windows 9x build succeeded.
You can find the download and the complete changelog since 1.0.5 behind the links on the top-left of this page.
<br/><br/>
Have fun with OpenTTD 1.1.0, or only do serious stuff today!
