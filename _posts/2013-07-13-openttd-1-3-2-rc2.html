Here it comes, OpenTTD 1.3.2-RC2, again with quite a number of bug squashed since the last release candidate. You can obtain it from the usual <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">download location</a> as well as view the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.3.2-RC2/changelog.txt">changelog</a>.

Among others, most notably a crash which could occur with some AIs was fixed, slowdowns were removed when showing windows with many strings like the advanced settings as well as connection issues with the content server under certain conditions.
