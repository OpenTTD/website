<p>
Here is the <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">next beta release</a> of the upcoming stable branch. There's a number of new feature, especially related to game scripts. But you now can also go BIG, maps up to 4096 x 4096 tiles are now feasible.<br/> The list of fixes is also quite notable. Among them crashes related to threaded drawing. We also hope to have fixed a nasty desync bug which could occur with earlier releases related to bancrupting or autocleaned companies. A full list of changes can be <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.0-beta5/changelog.txt">found here</a>.
</p><p>
Please test also this new beta extensively and help to make the 1.4.0 release the best release ever :) If you find any bugs, please
report them to our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>. If you have questions, please make use of our <a href="http://forum.openttd.org">forums</a>.

If your the translation into the language of your choice is lacking, now is a good time to bring it into good shape (see our <a href="http://translator.openttd.org">web translator</a> and the <a href="http://translator.openttd.org/en/faq">FAQ</a> for how to apply)
Only this way you can make sure that the final 1.4.0 will have a full and complete translation. At his point I'd also like to draw your
attention to the ongoing <a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/round1/index.html">vote for the new title game</a>.

Enjoy,<br/>
Your OpenTTD team
