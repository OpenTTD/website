Today we updated <a href="https://www.staging.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-useful/latest.html">openttd-useful.zip</a> to add an extra library. If you want to compile upcoming releases/nightlies/trunk you have to update.<br />
If you do not compile OpenTTD yourself or you are not using Microsoft's compiler you will not be affected.
