title: Centralized User Account
author: TrueBrain

<p>As of today, OpenTTD uses a centralized account system, with LDAP as its backend. This means that you will have one account to use all our services. No longer you will have to remember different passwords and changing your password is instant over all our services. From a management point of few it is also much better: we have much better overview in who has access to what, and we can fine grain it much better.</p>
<p>If you already have an account, we made it possible for you to merge those accounts into a single new one. The page at <a href="http://account.openttd.org/merge">http://account.openttd.org/merge</a> helps you through it.</p>
<p>After creating a new account or merge existing ones, you can use the following services with that account:
<ul><li>Account</li>
<li>BaNaNaS</li>
<li>Bugs</li>
<li>Translator</li>
<li>Wiki</li></ul>
Other services will follow in the future.</p>
<p>NOTE: tt-forums.net is not inside the OpenTTD domain, and therefore not shared with this account. Such link might be created in the future, but it is not planned.</p>
<p>As always, if there are any problems, please let us know.</p>
