Third, er, Fourth try's the charm? You found some bugs that needed fixing before the full release of OpenTTD 15. Let's do one last (we hope) Release Candidate.

We've fixed two crashes related to station windows and signs, a hang related to implicit orders, and have stopped cacti from dying off completely with some tree spread settings.

As always, if you spot any more bugs, please [report them here](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose).

We've heard from many of our translators that they've finished their languages. If your language needs updating, it's the last chance! Check on your language [here](https://translator.openttd.org/project/openttd-master).
