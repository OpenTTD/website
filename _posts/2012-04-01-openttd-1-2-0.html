<p>As anticipated by many, we present you a new release today.
</p><p>
With this release we introduce a number of major fixes like issues
with aircraft freezing mid-flight, time-tabled travel at 0 km/h, wrongly
skipped sprites, imported sounds, or reversing trains. See the <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.2.0-RC4/changelog.txt">full
changelog</a> for details.
</p><p>
Have fun playing and testing, and please make sure that you report any bugs
 you encounter to our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.
</p><p>
Enjoy and happy Easter,<br>
your foolish OpenTTD team
