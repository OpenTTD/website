Hello,
<br/><br/>
as of today we present the brand new OpenTTD 1.1.2 which got two important bug fixes with respect to its preceeding release candidate which fix potential crashes in cases with unknown or missing languages when using NewGRFs referencing these languages and with some broken savegames.
<br/><br/>
Get the new version from the usual locations and should you discover any bugs, please report them to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
Enjoy!
