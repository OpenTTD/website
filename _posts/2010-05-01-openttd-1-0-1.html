Today we released OpenTTD 1.0.1, the first maintenance release of the 1.0 series.
It fixes quite a number of bugs, including some serious <a href="http://security.openttd.org">security vulnerabilities</a> which can quite spoil online playing.<br/>
We urge server owners to update as soon as possible.
