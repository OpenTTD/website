title: Translation Teams move to GitHub

Today is a big day for translations of OpenTTD!
Translators are now organised as teams of our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/OpenTTD).

That means:
* You no longer need an OpenTTD-specific account to become a translator: you can use [GitHub accounts](https://github.com) for most OpenTTD things now.
  ([bug tracker](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues), [BaNaNaS](https://bananas.openttd.org)), [translations](https://translator.openttd.org), [development](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD), ...)
* Becoming a translator is now super easy: you just [click a few buttons](https://github.com/OpenTTD/team/issues/new/choose) to become a member of the team.
* There is one team for each language, which allows the translators to get to know each other, and have group conversations within the team.

There is only one downside:
* Everyone who was a translator before needs to [reapply](https://github.com/OpenTTD/team/issues/new/choose).

While this is good news for all translators, this is also a great step forward for our infrastructure:
after migrating the source code and bug tracker in 2019, this year we could migrate BaNaNaS and the WebTranslator.
This only leaves the [Wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org) as last service that still needs an OpenTTD-specific account. (guess what task is next?)
