Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town.
And he's brought a gift with him.

Here's a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release.

It comes faster, with road waypoints, less passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs.
To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights:
* Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints.
* Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default.
* Password-less network authentication using keys.
* Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support.
* Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement.
* A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes.
* Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now.

There's a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and [report anything you find amiss](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose), to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
