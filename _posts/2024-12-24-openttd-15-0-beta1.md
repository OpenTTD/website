Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town.
And he's brought a gift with him.

Here's a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta release of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 version.



Some of the main features and changes are:
* Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints.
* Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default.
* Password-less network authentication using keys.
* Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support.
* Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement.
* A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes.
* Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now.

We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 15.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release.
But for now, play the game, and please [report any issues](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose) you find.
