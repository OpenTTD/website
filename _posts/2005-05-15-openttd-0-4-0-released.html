It has been a while, but finally OpenTTD 0.4.0 is out. Things took a bit longer than expected, and everyone was busy, but it is done.
Expect yet another major update. This time bigger maps, "unlimited" amount of towns, industries, stations, etc., heavily improved and protected network-gameplay, a new, smart, pathfinder, multiple busstops, etc. Too much to say all at once.<br>
Download 0.4.0 right now and enjoy the game!
