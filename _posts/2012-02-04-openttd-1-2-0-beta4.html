If the temperature outside is not enough reason to stay at home playing OpenTTD, here is another one: The next beta of OpenTTD 1.2!
<br/><br/>
While it contains some features, you might not notice them unless you are a developer of NewGRF, NoAI or NoGo add-ons.
However, beta 4 also includes some imporant bug fixes for desyncs and NoAI/NoGo scripts locking up OpenTTD.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing the beta, so we can quickly get a new stable!
You can find the download, changelog and readme in the <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">usual place</a>.
Bugs are reported best to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
Also note that the deadline for submissions to the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=57555">titlegame competiton</a>
is approaching quickly.
<br/><br/>
Have fun playing OpenTTD 1.2.0-beta4! (even if you have to wear gloves)
