title: Looking for translators
author: Rubidium

For a long time we have had a lot of translators for different languages.
Most languages made it to 100% completion, but in the last year(s) many of
them have been stalling. For example Hebrew and Esperanto have over 500
untranslated strings while there have been times where they were fully
translated. Most of this is due to new features of the last year(s),
especially the descriptions for all the advanced settings or the reduction
of the number of windows where settings can be changed.
<br/><br/>
Via this way we would like to ask for people to help with translating those
languages that have many untranslated strings. These are mostly languages
that seem to have been neglected in the last year and thus need your help.
<br/><br/>
Becoming a translator for a particular language is relatively straight
forward. Just follow the steps described in the 
<a href="http://translator.openttd.org/en/faq">FAQ</a> of our web
translator. In short this means creating an account and then asking for
translation rights for that language.
<br/><br/>
The following languages have more than 100 but less than 10% untranslated
strings. These can be brought up to date with relatively little effort as
roughly 200 strings need to be translated.
<ul>
 <li>Afrikaans</li>
 <li>Arabic (Egypt)</li>
 <li><del>Chinese (Simplified)</del></li>
 <li><del>Danish</del></li>
 <li><del>English (Australian)</del></li>
 <li><del>Estonian</del></li>
 <li>Malay</li>
 <li><del>Norwegian (Bokmal)</del></li>
 <li>Norwegian (Nynorsk)</li>
 <li><del>Portuguese</del></li>
 <li><del>Romanian</del></li>
 <li>Serbian</li>
 <li><del>Slovak</del></li>
 <li><del>Slovenian</del></li>
 <li>Turkish</li>
 <li>Welsh</li>
</ul>
The following languages have more than 10% untranslated strings, but had all
strings translated at some time. Bringing these languages up to date will
require some effort as, on average, 500 strings need to be translated.
<ul>
 <li><del>Arabic (Egypt)</del></li>
 <li><del>Bulgarian</del></li>
 <li><del>Chinese (Traditional)</del></li>
 <li>Esperanto</li>
 <li>Galician</li>
 <li><del>Hebrew</del></li>
 <li><del>Icelandic</del></li>
 <li>Irish</li>
 <li>Japanese</li>
</ul>
The following languages have never reached "finished" status, which means
they never reached more than 90%. Getting these languages up into a
"finished" state mean translating, on average, over 2000 strings. Most of
these translations have been stagnant for years, and has driven us to a
policy where we want to see a 90% translated language file before including
it into the game.
<ul>
 <li>Chuvash</li>
 <li>Faroese</li>
 <li>Frisian</li>
 <li>Ido</li>
 <li>Macedonian</li>
 <li>Maltese</li>
 <li>Marathi</li>
 <li>Persian</li>
 <li>Tamil</li>
 <li>Thai</li>
 <li>Urdu</li>
</ul>
The precise number of untranslated strings can be seen on the 
<a href="http://translator.openttd.org/en/status">statistics page</a> of our
web translator. My hope is that, during the following weeks, these lists are 
reduced in size and maybe even become empty.
