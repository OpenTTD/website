<p>Time for yet another beta release in the 1.1.0 series. Quite some bugs have been fixed since the
last beta and a few further additions have been made and the advanced settings saw some major
cleanup. You can view the <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.1.0-beta5/changelog.txt">complete changelog</a> at the usual location.</p>
<p>Please report any bugs you might find in this version in <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">our bug tracker</a> so that OpenTTD will
become even better and more stable for the upcoming stable release.
