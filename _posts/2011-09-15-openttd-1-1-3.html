<p>Today we released OpenTTD 1.1.3. Compared to the previous release candidate it brings you three important bug fixes for situations which could crash the game.
</p><p>
Note also that users of Windows XP which do NOT have service pack 3 now need to use the binary for windows95/98/2k due to <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=970559#p970559">changes in the compiler</a>
</p><p>
Find the game on our <a href="http://www.openttd.org/en/download-stable">website</a> and have fun with it :-)
Please report bugs in our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a></p>
