The new stable release OpenTTD 1.1.1 has arrived. Besides a lot of bug fixes it also
modifies some of the features added in 1.1.0 which caused some confusion.
<br/><br/>
For example 'automatic orders' are now called 'implicit orders' and their insertion behaves better
in various cases. However, note that implicit orders do not affect the actual routing of the vehicles,
they are currently purely informative.
Also the visualisation of train lengths in the depot view changed again.
The number got an additional fractional digit to improve the visual feedback on adding wagons as well
as allowing to construct trains of very specific lengths.
<br/><br/>
Now, enjoy June with the new release! You can find the download link at the top of this page, and the detailed changelog next to the download.
