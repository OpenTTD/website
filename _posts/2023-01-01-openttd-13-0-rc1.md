Rejoice, for we are now in feature freeze for the 13.0 release series just in time for a new year!

Some last minute features and fixed made it into the new year.
Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles.
On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces.

Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up, and report any issues as normal!
