OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we've found some bugs to fix.

Most notably, we've fixed two kinds of crashes:
* Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains.
* The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town's local authority.

For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we've added a callback to select how the engine's name is displayed in the buy menu.

As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog.
