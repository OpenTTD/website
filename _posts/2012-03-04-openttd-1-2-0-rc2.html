<p>With OpenTTD 1.2.0-RC2 we present you with another release candidate for the upcoming stable release.

</p><p>
As usual, the release candidates didn't get any new features, but we've been busy fixing bugs found
in the last release candidate. Among <a href=http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.2.0-RC2/changelog.txt>
other things</a> the game scripts now can access correctly the vehicle orders, sprite offsets for the
additional zoom levels had sometimes wrong offsets or wrongly padded and a desync where the maximum
travel speed from the orders was not always properly communicated.
</p><p>
At the same time we'd like to draw your attention to the annual <a href=http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/round2/index.html>title game competition</a>. It's in its
final round and from the three best entries the single best entry must be found. Have a look at
the choices, make up your mind and vote.
</p><p>
Please test also this new release candidate thoroughly and report any bug you find to our
<a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.
</p><p>
Enjoy the game!</p>
