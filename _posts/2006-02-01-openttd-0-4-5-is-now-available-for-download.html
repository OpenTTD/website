A long time in the making, more than 8 months, OpenTTD 0.4.5 has finally been released. Improved multi-player, newgrf, autoreplace and countless other fixes/features have been added. Also the downloads are quite bigger than the last one as you can see because we have included 16 scenarios with the release; a result of a semi-contest on the forums. We hope you enjoy them.

As usual, you can find the release on SourceForge.<br>
