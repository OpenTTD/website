<p>From the first round of votes the three most popular games have been shortlisted, entries 02, 11 and 13 (kept as numbers till voting is closed to not make it a vote for names game). Now it's time to choose from these three most favourite ones the single most favourite one. The winner of this round is the savegame which will be shipped with all OpenTTD 1.4.x releases. Every person has one vote exactly.
</p><p>
Deadline for votes is March 15th 23:59 UTC.
</p><p>
You can either vote by writing me a <a href=http://tt-forums.net/>forum message</a> with the topic "titlegame competition" or write an <a href=mailto:planetmaker@openttd.org?subject=Titlegame>e-mail to me</a>.
