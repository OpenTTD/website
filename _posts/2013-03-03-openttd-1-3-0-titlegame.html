<p>The recent years we had so many good entries that we decided to give some of them another spin. Thus for this year you have the choice for the titlegame of the upcoming 1.3 release of OpenTTD. You can choose between the uprunners of the last three titlegame competitions.</p>

An overview over the contestants including savegames and screenshots at various resolutions can be found on the <a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/">titlescreen's competition page</a>.
