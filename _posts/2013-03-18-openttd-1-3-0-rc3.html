Here comes OpenTTD 1.3.0-RC3 with a number of fixes and a new titlegame for the 1.3 series. Congratulations to Emperor Jake on creating that savegame. The changelog is found in the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.3.0-RC3/changelog.txt">usual place</a>.
Hopefully it can be the last of the release candidates for the upcoming stable release.
</p><p>
Please help test this release candidate and thus help us to make sure that the stable release really deserves its name :-) Any bugs you encounter go as
usual to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>

Enjoy and thanks for your support!
