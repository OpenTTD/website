1.4 stabilisation has progressed, so today you get the first release candidate for the new stable.

Most noticeable it includes the new titlegame for the 1.4 series, which won the

Thanks to all participants!
<br/><br/>
Please give <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">OpenTTD 1.4.0-RC1</a> a final burst of testing and
report bugs to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our tracker</a>, so we can release a proper stable in a couple of weeks.
