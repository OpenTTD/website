title: Graphics and sound replacement complete
author: Rubidium

In this week both the graphics and sound replacement sets have been finished. We would like to thank the developers of both <a href="https://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx">OpenGFX</a> and <a href="https://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx">OpenSFX</a> for their effort.
<br/><br/>
This means that OpenTTD can now be played in full without the need for the graphics and sound files of Transport Tycoon Deluxe. However, for the sound replacement set to work you need a recent <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">nightly/trunk build</a>.
