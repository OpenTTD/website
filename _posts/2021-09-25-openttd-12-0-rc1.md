Rejoice, for we are now in feature freeze for the 12.0 release series!

One last flurry of features, including properly displaying when a vehicle is lost, and some new buttons for macOS TouchBar, if you have one.
A fair few fixes for the new networking setup, and a few other things besides.

Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up (multiplayer especially), and report any issues as normal!
