Today we have released 0.7.5-RC1. Primarily because cargo payment was broken for NewGRF cargos and we did not spot it before we released 0.7.4. So because we had to make another release to fix that we added some more fixes and would like to ask you to test whether it is fixed.
<br/>
Please note that this release does <b>not</b> add support for OpenSFX. For that you still need the nightlies/trunk.
