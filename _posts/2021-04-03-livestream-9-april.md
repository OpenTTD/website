Come ask us questions about OpenTTD!
After our fun but disagreeable second Twitch livestream [yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M96VjKihxNc) and a very successful release on Steam, we will host a chat Q&A stream on April 9th.
Tune in at 18:00 UTC on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/openttdlive/about) â€” here's a handy [countdown and time zone converter](https://a.chronus.eu/19B79F8).

LordAro, Timberwolf, TrueBrain and michi_cc will try but probably fail in answering all your questions you never dared to ask about OpenTTD in chat.
