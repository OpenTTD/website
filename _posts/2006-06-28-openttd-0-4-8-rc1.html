[Update] Files are finally online [/Update]<p/>

We're glad to announce OpenTTD 0.4.8 RC1. This is, as the name says a release candidate. If no problems are found the final will follow shortly.<p/>

OpenTTD 0.4.8 is a service pack for 0.4.7. Many problems have been addressed, network security has been tightened, and the gameplay has been improved in overall. You can, as always, find the not-so-full list of changes in the changelog file bundled with the release.<p/>

We ask you to test the release candidate as much as you can. If everything goes right 0.4.8 final will be the last OpenTTD version before 0.5.0.<br/>
As a sidenote: a few languages miss quite a couple of strings, mainly Icelandic (20) and Galician (30); it would be nice if some translators could translate these strings over at <a href="https://translator.openttd.org/">WebTranslator2</a>.<p/>

As always the files can be found in thze <a href=https://www.openttd.org/en/download-all>downloads</a> section and a longer announcement over at the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=460314#460314">forums</a>. It is possible that the files are not available at the moment, SourceForge is acting up, so please be patient.
