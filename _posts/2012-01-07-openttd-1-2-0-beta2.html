<p>New year and with OpenTTD 1.2.0-beta2 we present you the second testing
release of the 1.2 series. Like usual for beta releases we have quite a range
of bug fixes, some of which fix very nasty bugs in the network code, others which avoid crashes in certain situations.
</p><p>
But as it's a beta release we still have new features. Among those you can now use the game scripts to ask questions to the companies and check the NewGRF parameters also when playing.
</p><p>
Have fun with this new release, give it a proper swirl and test. As usual bugs
go to our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>, a full changelog is also <a href=http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.2.0-beta2/changelog.txt>available</a> and downloads can be found on our <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>main page</a>.
</p><p>
Finally let me remind you of the <a href=http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame>titlegame competition</a>. Playing and thus creating a nice titlegame might also be a good test ;-)
</p><p>
Enjoy!
