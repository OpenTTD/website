<p>We're moving quickly forward towards the next stable release version, starting with its first RC, <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>1.4.4-RC1</a>. This version fixes a crash which happened in some cases when 'full animation' was enabled in multiplayer mode. Also a small issue with cargo handling with cargo dist was fixed and compilation issues for a few less-frequently used platforms were resolved. Find the <a href=http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.4-RC1/changelog.txt>full changelog here</a>.
</p><p>
Please test this release candidate thoroughly so that the next release will be best and most stable OpenTTD ever :) If you find any issues, please make use of our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>bug tracker</a>.

Enjoy,<br>
Your OpenTTD team
