Today we release our second beta of our 1.11 release series!

This second beta is a huge one: we have spent much of the time between last beta and this on massively improving the performance of our video-drivers on all platforms.
With a huge thanks to michi_cc, we now even have OpenGL support!
Don't get your hopes up: it still is (and always will be) a 2D game.

To make sure these changes get their fair share of testing, we ask you to help us test them. Especially the following new features:
* OpenGL support for all platforms.
* Massive improvements to all video-drivers; so massive, we now have a setting to indicate an upper-limit to fast-forward speeds.
* Display now runs on 60fps.
* Generic Linux builds.

For a complete list of changes, please see the changelog.

Additionally, we are still searching for translators for 19 languages! 
Below is the list of languages that could really use a translator or two.
If you can read/write any of these languages, and are willing to help us out make the game look better in that language, please drop by https://translator.openttd.org/ and help us out!
We made things as easy as possible for you; all we need from you is a few minutes of your time to translate strings from English to your language.

With this new beta, we are slowly wrapping up 1.11, meaning we are closing in on a feature-freeze: a period of time we do not accept new features, but focus on any and all bugs we are aware of.
This means it is a perfect time for you to report any you have!

Please do help us test, and let us know how you like the improvements we made!
