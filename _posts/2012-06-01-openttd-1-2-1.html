It's friday. If you like fish, you might be happy. If you don't, well, how about OpenTTD 1.2.1?
<br/><br/>
The first maintenance release of the 1.2 series delivers you a lot of bug fixes, so hopefully a nice playing experience.
Most notable the lagging experienced in certain circumstances with 1.2.0 on the title screen and in-game should be gone.
<br/><br/>
You can find the download in the usual spot at <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-stable">http://www.openttd.org/download-stable</a>, and also
a detailed changelog next to it.
<br/><br/>
Have fun and a nice weekend playing OpenTTD!
