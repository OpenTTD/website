title: OpenTTD on Steam

Historically, OpenTTD always had a single home from where we distribute the game.
We used to be hosted on SourceForge (you know you are old if you remember that being a thing :D), and slowly moved towards our own self-created distribution methods.
These days, we mostly distribute our game via [our website](https://www.openttd.org).

But times are changing, and so are we.
Over the last few months, we have silently been working on become a bit more visible in the world.
Not for reasons you might think: OpenTTD has as many active users as we had in 2007.
But more because we no longer think it is the right approach to only distribute via our own website.

This became painfully apparent when we noticed someone posted OpenTTD, the exact binary we created, on some stores, asking money for it.
For us, that hurts a little bit: we put in all the effort to bring the best game we can, without asking anything in return, and someone else just posts it, unchanged, on a game store and charges money for it.
I do not mind if people make money for work they did .. but making money from work I did, that just feels wrong.
But, legally, they are fully allowed.
So, instead of fighting it, why not turn around and join them .. just do it for free ;)
That should weed out people who do not add additional value to the game, and try to ask money for it, not? :D

And this is exactly what we have been doing lately.
And when I say "we", a bit ironic to me, I mean the two developers that are around longest (myself and orudge).

A while back orudge added OpenTTD to the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/openttd-official/9ncjg5rvrr1c).
And today, I am happy to announce we will be on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536610/OpenTTD/) too!

Well, we are on Steam, but we haven't released anything there yet (sorry that I just got your hopes up, just to squash them right after :( ).
This is partially because of how Steam works, but also because we know we can bring a better experience for Steam with our upcoming release.
That brings me to the most exciting news: if everything goes as planned, we will release OpenTTD 1.11 on Steam on the first of April, 2021!
And that is not even an [April fools'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day) joke!

You can already Wishlist OpenTTD today .. and till we release on Steam, you can find our game via [our website](https://www.openttd.org) ;)

Enjoy!
