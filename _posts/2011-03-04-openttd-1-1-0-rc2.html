title: OpenTTD 1.1.0-RC2
author: frosch
---

In case your plan was to help testing RC1 over the weekend: We are sorry.
However, you are welcome to help testing RC2 :)
<br/><br/>
The second release candidate contains a lot of bug fixes and is a big step forward to stabilising OpenTTD 1.1.
Unlike previous betas and RC1 it does not offer any new features though. But more stability is also a gameplay-improvement!
You can find the download in the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">usual spot</a> together with the changelog.
Please report any bugs to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bugtracker</a>.
Don't be afraid to register at the bugtracker, fixing bugs often requires bi-directional communication between reporters and developers.
<br/><br/>
Finally you should note that voting round 1 of the title game competition has been closed. The best three advanced to round 2 and you can
now vote for one of them to become the title game of the 1.1.x series of OpenTTD! Go straight to the
<a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/">voting page</a>; you do not even have to register for voting :p
