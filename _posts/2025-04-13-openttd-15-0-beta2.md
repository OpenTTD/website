April 1st has come and gone, but have no fear, for beta2 is here.

We've fixed a bunch more since beta1, and need more testing. Also, we added some new features! Highlights include:
* Snow-covered rocks are now visible
* Steep hills from map generation or heightmap import now get extra rocks
* Houses can be individually placed by players in the scenario editor and (if enabled) in-game, and can be protected from replacement during town growth
* Touchpad two-finger map scrolling for Windows
* NewGRF Badges
* A variety of bugfixes

(As always, see the changelog for further details).

What are badges, you ask? Badges are something add-on (NewGRF) authors can put on their content to help you find e.g. the vehicle or station you want to use.
For example, various vehicle add-ons use a mix of different icons, overlay images or texts to indicate the power source or the suggested usage of a vehicle. With badges, this information can be represented in a clear way including built-in filtering, that is cohesive between different add-ons.

As this beta is the first release featuring badge support, there aren't many updated add-ons yet, but we're excited to see what authors do with the new feature.

Finally, the usual titlegame competition has been [announced on the forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=92166).
