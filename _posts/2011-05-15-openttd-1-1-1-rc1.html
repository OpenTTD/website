Today we released the first release candidate for the upcoming next stable release.
Originally we wanted to wait for November 11th for the release, but then that felt a bit unpleasant. So here is OpenTTD 1.1.1-RC1 :)
<br/><br/>
This first bug fix release of the 1.1. series fixes various issues with the previous release,
though we are actually quite happy with the status of the 1.1. series. The previous 1.0 and 0.7 series required bug fix releases a lot earlier.
So, please help testing the release candidate and try to disprove that bold pronouncement. If you encounter any issues, report them to our
<a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/index.php?string=&project=1&type[]=1">bug tracker</a>. Thanks in advance!
