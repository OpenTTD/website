Some of you might have a long weekend ahead, and after sobering up you might want to enjoy some game of OpenTTD. (Just don't build level crossings.)
<br/><br/>
With the first release candidate for 1.2.1 we give you the opportunity to test the upcoming next stable release of the 1.2 series.
As usual this is a maintenance release, so it comes with a lot of bug fixes, including some desyncs, crashes or general slowness.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing so we get a stable and nice release. Just report any bugs you encounter to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bugtacker</a>. You can find the download and changelog under "download testing" at the top of this page.
<br/><br/>
Thanks and Have Fun!
