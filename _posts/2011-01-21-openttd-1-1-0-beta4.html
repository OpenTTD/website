title: OpenTTD 1.1.0-beta4

Dear players, developers and admins,
<br/><br/>
another step for 1.1.0 has been made, the beta4. It contains a lot of bugfixes, including fix for crash/hangup on opening the smallmap window on big-endian platforms and several savegame conversion fixes.<br/>
Apart from that, important changes are in the Place Object and Build Rail Station windows. Now, you can select the item you want from a graphical preview - see <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=41222">the forum</a>.<br/>
Many players and NewGRF developers will welcome better support for NewGRF railtypes, and server admins can now (re)set the password of any company.
<br/><br/>
List of important changes is in the <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.1.0-beta4/changelog.txt">changelog</a> - it's even longer than the changelog for beta2 and beta3.
<br/><br/>
Any bugs you find should be reported at <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">our bug tracker</a> - please report them, as it makes OpenTTD better :-)
<br/><br/>
Stay tuned for further betas and/or RCs - not talking about the final 1.1.0 release :-)
