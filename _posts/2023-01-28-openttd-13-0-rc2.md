OpenTTD 13.0-RC2 is now available, which fixes a bunch of issues found during RC1 playtesting.

Most fixes are related to AI/GS scripting, the recent GUI zoom improvements and the engine variant support.
(As ever, see the changelog for further details).

With only a short time left before release, please take the effort to test our latest Release Candidate, to find any issues that are still left!
Any issues can be reported in the usual [place](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues).

Additionally, if you are a translator, please see if [your language has any missing translations](https://translator.openttd.org/project/openttd-master).
