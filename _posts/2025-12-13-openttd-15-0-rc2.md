Today we release 15.0-RC2, the second release candidate for the upcoming release.
You've found several issues in the first release candidate, mostly related to the expanded font rendering.
In the interest of stability, we've backed most of them out again, for a return at a later date when the feature is more stable.
As always, see the changelog for the full list.

However, there is a good chance there are still some issues out there that haven't been found yet.
Please help us hunt those down, and if you find one, you can [report them here](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose).

Translation updates are coming in every day, and while some languages are complete or are nearing completion, there are also translations with missing or outdated strings.
If you are a translator, please see if [your language has any missing translations](https://translator.openttd.org/project/openttd-master).
We greatly appreciate your contribution!
