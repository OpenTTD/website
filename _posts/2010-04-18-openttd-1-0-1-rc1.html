More users result in more bugreports, which result in more bug fixes, which result in more releases. So, it's time for the first release candidate for 1.0.1.<br/><br/>
For the new users, who are not yet aware of OpenTTD's versioning schema: 1.0.1 is going to be a bugfix release, so do not expect any big features. Most noticeable are some desync fixes. So please help testing the release candidate, so 1.0.1 becomes as stable as possible.
