This weekend we released the first release candidate for the upcoming OpenTTD 1.0.2.
It is a maintenance release without big new features, but with a lot of bugfixes.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing the release candidate, whether it is as good as we intend it to be, or whether something
unforeseen sneaked in. You can find the download as well as the detailed changelog at the very topleft of this page.
