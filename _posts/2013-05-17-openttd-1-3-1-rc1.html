<p>Time for an update to our 1.3 series. With the first release candidate to OpenTTD 1.3.1 we even ship a few features related to translations:<br>
The translators of Scottish Gaelic and Faroese have been very busy so we now ship also those translations. Generally there are now slightly improved translations of the base sets.
</p><p>
Of course being a bug-fix release there's also a lot of bug fixes which accumulated since the release of 1.3.0. Notably there's a number of fixes related to sound effects and vehicle speeds.</p><p>
You find the full list of changes and fixes in the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.3.1-RC1/changelog.txt">changelog</a>. Please give this version a sound test and report any bugs and probelms you encounter in our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>.

Have fun!<br>
Your OpenTTD team</p>
