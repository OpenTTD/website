We are getting closer to OpenTTD 1.1.0. Today we released the third release candidate.
<br/><br/>
Most noticeable is the new intro game, which was determined via a competition over the past weeks/months.
We would like to thank all participants submitting pleasing games to look at!
They were all nice, but only 3 could advance to the second round. Interestingly one of each of the 3 'normal' climates made it there.
In the end the <a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/">final vote</a> turned out quite close; Romazoon's tropic game won
by a narrow margin of 2 votes.
<br/><br/>
Now, enjoy the new intro game, and - of course - the bugfixes, which <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">OpenTTD 1.1.0-RC3</a>
offers as well :) Nevertheless, please keep on reporting bugs to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">bug tracker</a>.
