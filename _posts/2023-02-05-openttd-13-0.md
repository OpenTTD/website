Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is finally available!

This version brings numerous additions to the game, both on the UI side and on the gameplay side.

Some of the highlights are:
* Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups.
* Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window.
* Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows.
* NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list.
* Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing.
* Custom league tables for GameScripts.
* More natural river generation during mapgen.
* And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements!

Additional to features and improvements, OpenTTD 13.0 comes with lots of bug fixes for a variety of issues.

Compared to the previous RC2 testing release, there were only three minor bug fixes.
(As ever, see the changelog for further details).
