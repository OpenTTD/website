<p>With OpenTTD 1.2.0-RC1 we present you the first release candidate of the upcoming stable release.
</p><p>
This release brings a few nice features like you now can assign speed limits to your surface vehicles. And
for NewGRF developers we added a new NewGRF format where a whole bunch of new
sprite types may be defined directly via NewGRF:<br>
Commonly and previously referred to only as "extra-zoom" OpenTTD now supports sprites for all zoom levels
and all colour depths. Thus a NewGRF may supply sprites in both 8bpp and 32bpp directly and additionally to the 
normal 1x view it may provide 2x and 4x zoom-in and 2x, 4x and 8x zoom-out sprites - a lot work for NewGRF authors
ahead :-) They might want to visit the <a href=http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net>NewGRF specs wiki</a> for details.</p><p>
Of course there's also the fair amount of bug fixes, among them handling of refit for vehicles in some cases, 
networking issues or adjustment of the infrastructure cost for rail which now sums over all rails irrespective of railtype.
See the <a href=http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.2.0-RC1/changelog.txt>full changelog</a> for more
</p><p>
