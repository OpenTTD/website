<p>It's weekend and time to play. Maybe a new game with the brand new <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>OpenTTD 1.4.2</a>?
</p><p>
In the RC2 no major show stoppers were found, so we release this now as stable version. See the changelog <a href=https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.4.2/changelog.txt>here</a>.
If you find any bugs, please <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org/>tell us</a> and report it in our bug tracker. Otherwise enjoy and possibly tell others :)

Enjoy,<br>
Your OpenTTD team
