<p>It's the season again for gifts and goodies. So we also have a goody for you: OpenTTD 1.4.0-beta1, the first beta of the next major release.
</p><p>
There's a number of features new to this version. The largest feature certainly is the long-craved for cargo distribution (CargoDist). But there's a lot of
other enhancements like goal scripts now support much more elaborate descriptions, NewObjects can be now much more numerous and diverse and also be placed upon map creation,
windows can remember their sizes. And many more. You can find the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.0-beta1/changelog.txt">full changelog</a>
