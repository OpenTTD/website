What's this? A sPoOoKy 1.10 beta release?!

OpenTTD 1.10.0-beta1 is now published.

Several big features this time round, the biggest of which would be NRT, or NewGRF RoadTypes.
This allows NewGRFs to add different types of roads similarly to what they can do for RailTypes already.
Also featured are big improvements to vehicle pathfinding performance, more flexible docks (multiple per station!), the ability to highlight station and town coverage areas, and many more!

There's still some stuff to fix yet, but we're pretty confident this release won't immediately crash on you :)

See the changelog for further details.

If you're really good boys and girls and androids, you might get a 1.10.0 stable release for Christmas...
