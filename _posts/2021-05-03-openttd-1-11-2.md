Today we released our second bugfix release of the 1.11 release series!

This release mainly addresses several crashes on startup, mostly caused by our shiny new OpenGL driver.
More people should now be able to enjoy OpenTTD out-of-the-box!

And as always, we also fixed tons of other small bugs and problems that were reported and found.
See the changelog for more detail.
