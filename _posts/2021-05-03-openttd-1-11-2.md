Today we released our second bugfix release of the 1.11 release series!

We found the cause of several OpenGL related crashes, mostly on Intel GPUs.
This release should fix most of those issues, meaning more people can enjoy OpenTTD out-of-the-box!

And as always, we also fixed tons of other small bugs and problems that were reported and found.
See the changelog for more detail.
