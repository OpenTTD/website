Weekend is over, the next week has started already... do you need an excuse to have some fun? :)
How about <s>pl</s> testing a software product? Here is a release candidate for a serious transport simulation - well, ok it's OpenTTD.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing OpenTTD 1.0.4-RC1, it contains a bunch of bug fixes, again including some desync issues.
You can have fun playing, and if you find an issue, you can report it at <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bugs.openttd.org</a>,
and offer us some fun fixing it in return :p
You can reach the download and detailed changelog as usual by following the link in the topleft of this page.
