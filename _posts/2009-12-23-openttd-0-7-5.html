Today we have released 0.7.5. This fixes the NewGRF cargo payment was that broken in 0.7.4 and a major bug that can crash servers remotely (CVE-2009-4007). We urge all server owners to update their servers, and as a result the players to do the same.
<br/><br/>
Please note that this release does <b>not</b> add support for OpenSFX. For that you still need the nightlies/trunk.
