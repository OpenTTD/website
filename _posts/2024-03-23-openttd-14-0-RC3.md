Features: added. Gameplay: improved. Bugs: squashed. Final testing pre-release: probably, unless time is (accidentally stopped)[https://www.openttd.org/news/2024/03/23/timekeeping].

Today we release 14.0-RC3, hopefully the last release candidate before the proper 14.0 release.
Compared to the previous RC, some annoying bugs were fixed and the latest translation updates included.
