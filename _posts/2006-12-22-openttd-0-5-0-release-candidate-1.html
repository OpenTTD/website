Just days before Christmas we bring you OpenTTD 0.5.0 RC1. Massive amounts of features, fixes and updates make this a more than worthy update.<br/>
Go ahead, play it, but not too much to spoil your Christmas, and report any bugs back to us so we can swiftly release a final.

There are a few things you need to be aware of. This mainly concerns Win9x users as mentioned in the previous news item, but also non-latin speakers should read the announcement on the <a href="http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=532327" target="_blank">forums</a>.

A few languages are missing quite a few strings: Ukrainian (28), Icelandic (217), Galician (173), Finnish (26), Esperanto (222), Estonian (26), Danish (23), Czech (34) and Bulgarian (39) it would be nice to see these translated as soon as possible. Note that languages missing <b>too</b> many strings will be moved to the unfinished section and not added to a release. If you are interested, head over the the <a href="https://translator.openttd.org/" target="_blank">Webtranslator v2</a>. The files are in the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/en/download-stable">downloads</a> section and reports should be reported to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/" target="_blank">Flyspray</a>.
