The time is finally here: 12.0 is officially released!

12.0 is our "multiplayer update", where we make playing together as easy as possible.
No more port-forwarding or other stuff: start a server and ask your friend(s) to join.
We take care of the rest.
For more details, please read our blog: [New Multiplayer Experience](https://www.openttd.org/news/2021/09/26/new-multiplayer-experience.html)

Besides this major update, 12.0 also comes with some other nice features:
- Display icon/text whether vehicle is lost
- Multiple rotating views on title screen
- Hide block signals in GUI by default (you can toggle this in the settings)
- Raise the maximum NewGRF limit to 255

To name just a few. And as always, we made sure to include 85 fixes in this release.

A special thanks go to our translators: they managed to translate the game in 29 (!) languages in full.

We hope you enjoy this new version, and make sure to try it out with a friend!
