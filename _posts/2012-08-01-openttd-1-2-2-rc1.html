It has been a while since the last release. We tried to get OpenTTD accepted as Olympic sport, but did not succeed so far.
Finally, we made a release candidate instead. 
<br/><br/>
You can get OpenTTD 1.2.2-RC1 at the usual <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">location for release candidates</a>.
This release contains a lot of bug fixes, which you should not miss out.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing OpenTTD, especially on different versions of Windows, and report the problems you encounter to
<a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
Thanks, and have fun!
