Today we released the first release candidate for the upcoming next stable release.
OpenTTD 1.1.3-RC1 contains the usual amount of bugfixes, but also the linux compile farm has been fixed, so generic linux binaries are again
linked statically.<br/><br/>In contrast to what is stated on the download pages, Windows 2000 users have to use the Win9x build for now.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing the release candidate. If you encounter any issues, report them to our
<a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/index.php?string=&project=1&type[]=1">bug tracker</a>. Thanks!
