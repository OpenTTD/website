The recent time anomaly allowed to prepare for a new release.
<a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">OpenTTD 1.6.0 RC1</a> features a bunch of <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/binaries/releases/1.6.0-RC1/changelog.txt">NewGRF additions and GUI tweaks</a>.
So, watch out for the NewGRFs in the pipeline, most prominently FIRS 2.
<br/><br/>
Please help test the release candidate for yet undocumented features, and report
issues to the <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
Have fun!
