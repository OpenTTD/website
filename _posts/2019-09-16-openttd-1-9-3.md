OpenTTD 1.9.3 is now published.

Yet another service release for 1.9, while we are also working towards making a 1.10 version.

This release especially focuses on two issues hitting macOS users:
Many have had really bad performance, with framerates below 10 on the title screen.
The cause was identified to be colourspace conversions happening (big thanks to SoothedTau in [issue #7644](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/7644)) and found a fix.
There is a risk this causes incorrect colours, hopefully that's an acceptable trade-off.
Additionally, some misconfigured multiplayer servers have been sending out server names with invalid UTF-8 text, revealing a bug in text handling on macOS, causing crashes.
This has also been fixed.

Apart from those two bugs, there are also some other improvements: UI scaling fixes, text fixes, file browser sorting, and it's become a little easier to send vehicles to oil rigs and other water industries.
For those playing city builder scenarios in particular, a certain playstyle was causing crashes when building road stops over one-way roads, this is also fixed.
