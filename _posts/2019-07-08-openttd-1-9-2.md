OpenTTD 1.9.2 is now published.

It turns out there were still things to improve and things to fix, and a little late is better than never.
This version fixes several slightly obscure bugs, and hopefully makes a few things easier to find.
Those playing on high-resolution monitors (such as 4k) and use the UI scaling options should also find that things appear less squished than they used to.
