Today we created a new <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-useful-releases/latest.html">openttd-useful.zip</a> with updated libaries and we added a library needed for properly rendering right-to-left scripts.<br />
If you are compiling yourself on Windows with Microsoft's C compiler from Visual Studio you need to update when you compile trunk or any development branch of OpenTTD as soon as possible, otherwise OpenTTD will fail to compile. For stable releases until the 0.7 series you can still use the old openttd-useful.zip.<br /><br />

If you do not compile OpenTTD yourself or you are not using Microsoft's compiler you will not be affected.
