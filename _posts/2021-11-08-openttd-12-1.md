We thought it time for a bugfix release.

We've addressed some of the more prominent criticisms of the 12.0 release along with a few others.
Notably the scrolling titlescreen will no longer scroll when you're interacting with the game (and fixed the occasional crash) and we've added a nice button to reenable the advanced signals that we're pretty sure you don't need to be using anyway.

More details in the changelog below.
