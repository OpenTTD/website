Welcome to our Monthly Dev Post of April 2019.
Every month one of these post will be created, to tell you about the latest developments in the world of OpenTTD.

## Development

### Highlights

## NewGRF

## Ponies

A "pony" is a personal pet project of a developer or community member. This section will be used in the future to showcase a project in detail.

 ### Participate yourself

 Do you have an interesting Project you are currently working on in relation to OpenTTD?
These Monthly Dev Posts are prepared in a branch on our [GitHub website project](https://github.com/OpenTTD/website/tree/monthly-dev-post/_posts/2019-04-01-monthly-dev-post.md) before they are made public on the website.
As soon as you are whitelisted as a contributor, it's as simple as editing the file in the web interface.
If you are not a contributor yet, drop by on [IRC](https://www.openttd.org/contact.html) to become one (make sure you have a GitHub account).
