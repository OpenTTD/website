Release Candidate 3 has been unleashed to the unsuspecting crowds. 
Download, play, enjoy and get addicted ^^.<p/>

Downloads can be found in the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">downloads</a> section or by clicking on the lighthouse to the right; report bugs to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/" target="_blank">Flyspray</a>.<p/>

Most notable changes between RC2 and RC3 are the once-again working signal propagation when editing your tracks that some of you might have noticed, a few crash fixes (station building, news-windows), better newgrf safety scans to allow unifont for example in the static section and the addition of an official Lithuanian translation. The forum post, which can be found <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=539340#539340" target="_blank">here</a>, gives you the full list of changes.</p>

And I know a lot of you have been waiting for this, so with any luck we will have an OS/2 binary for 0.5.0 final. Yes, you heard this right :D. Translators did a great job overall, the offer below by Mihamix still stands for 0.5.0 final.
