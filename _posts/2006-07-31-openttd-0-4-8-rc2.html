It seems some unfortunate organizational problems have prevented a swift release of RC2, dragging RC1 for a month instead of the supposed week.<br/>
RC1 had a nasty industry problem that prevented goods produced by them to be used. RC2 fixes this, along with a few other minor cornercases. Please test this version extensively, hopefully all is well.<p/>

As usual the files can be found in the <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>downloads</a> section and a longer announcement over at the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=26536">forums</a>.
