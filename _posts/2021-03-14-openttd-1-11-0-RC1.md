Today we release our first Release Candidate of our 1.11 release series!

The last two weeks we added a few more features we wanted to have for our 1.11 series, and fixed many bugs.
A few entries worth mentioning:
- Many build windows now have a way to filter lists. This is especially useful if you have many NewGRFs loaded.
- You can now select the Display Refresh rate and if Hardware Acceleration should be enabled or not from the Game Options.
- NewGRF Scanner and World Generation now feel a lot smoother and the GUI is more responsive while they are busy.
- Over 18 bug-fixes; that is more than 1 a day!

With this Release Candidate we will no longer accept new features for 1.11 and we will focus the next two weeks on bug-fixing and making sure 1.11 is as stable as we can get it.
If you find any bug with this Release Candidate, please report it to us so we can tackle it before the real release.

OpenTTD has been very busy in the last four weeks.
To put it in words of [GitHub Pulse Insight](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pulse/monthly) (as on the time of writing):
24 authors have pushed 253 commits to master. On master, 253 files have changed and there have been 26,262 additions and 6,060 deletions. 
We merged 113 Pull Requests and closed 69 bugs.

We wanted to thank everyone who contributed, both those that report issues and those that have been fixing them.
It means a lot to us that so many of you still care about a game this old!
