feature polish, adjustments to things bothering for years, bug fixes, performance improvements, ...

<li>Windows are arranged more conveniently, and you can now enable to close windows using the right mouse button.</li>
<li>Bankruptcy is now checked before reoccurring infrastructure costs are paid, so AI companies running on tight budget no longer close down as fast.</li>
<li>#coop's PublicServer game 325 now runs about 10% faster.</li>
<li>For those using the original base graphics: The consistency of the additional graphics across the climates were improved.</li>
