Today we updated <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful">openttd-useful.zip</a> to change a library to support natural sorting of strings. 
<br/>If you want to compile upcoming releases/nightlies/trunk you have to update, however if you want to compile OpenTTD before r21340 you will need <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful/3.4">version 3.4</a>. To be able to compile both OpenTTD revisions before and after r21340 you have to install <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful/3.4">version 3.4</a> first and then install <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful/4.0">version 4.0</a> over that.
<br/><br/>
If you do not compile OpenTTD yourself or you are not using Microsoft's compiler you will not be affected.
