OpenTTD 1.9.0-RC1 is now available, which means the 1.9 branch is now in feature freeze, so that's your lot in features!
Nothing particularly huge since beta3, but full [changelog](https://proxy.binaries.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.9.0-RC1/changelog.txt) and [download](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/testing.html) can be found in the usual places.

Please help with testing, any issues can be reported in the other usual [place](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues)

Enjoy!
