<p>It's again time for a new beta. The cargodist and autorefit got tested well, several bugs got squashed. The new SSE blitters were also further improved.
Not immediately noticable but useful in the future, are the new string codes to display amounts of cargo in NewGRFs. For our Korean users, the separators in numbers were fixed.
</p><p>
As usual, enjoy the <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>third beta release</a> of OpenTTD 1.4.0. If you find a bug, please report it at our <a href=http://bugs.openttd.org/>bug tracker</a>.
