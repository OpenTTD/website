title: Version 0.4.6 of OpenTTD is released
author: Darkvater

OpenTTD is back with a quick release. This time no new features only bugfixes. But at least this one is hot on the heels of 0.4.5 and should work more pleasantly. You can safely upgrade from 0.4.5 to this version as hopefully nothing has gotten broken, only fixed. Have fun.

As usual, you can find the release on SourceForge. The files are in the process of being uploaded and distributed so have a little patience when some releases are not found on SF.<br>
