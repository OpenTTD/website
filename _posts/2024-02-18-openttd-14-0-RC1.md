Today we released our first candidate for version 14!
That means we will start to focus on fixing the remaining bugs and stop adding new features.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues.
But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate.
Please share your findings on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose).

Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date.
For the other half, we might need your help with translating.
If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider [helping to finish your translation](https://www.openttd.org/development).
