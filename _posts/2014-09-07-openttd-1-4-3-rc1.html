A desync bug was found in 1.4, so we're moving forward to the next stable release rather quickly.
<br/><br/>
The desync was fixed, along with a number of other issues. Have a look at the <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.4.3-RC1/changelog.txt">changelog</a> for details.
<br/><br/>
As normal, please test this version, in particular in multi-player (MP) to check that the desync got solved. You can download the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">new release</a> now.
<br/><br/>
If you find any problems, please report them to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>.
