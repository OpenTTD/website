<p>Guess what day it is? <a href=https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6559>This innocent post</a> from 10 years ago may give you a hint!
</p><p>
It's a day to say thank you to all the players and especially to the many, many contributors we
 had and have throughout this time. What was said <a href=http://www.openttd.org/en/news/122>back 4 years</a> for our going 1.0.0 still 
is true, even more true: it was a lot of work of hundreds and thousands of people, coding, drawing,
composing, translating, both directly this game or on third-party projects
like the graphics, sound and music sets or libraries used by this game.
</p><p>
Also a big thank you to <a href=https://www.ovh.de/>OVH</a> who currently generously sponsors our hosting and bandwidths needs.
</p><p>
Last but not least also a big thank you to our <a href=http://devs.openttd.org/~truebrain/mirror.txt>mirrors</a> which make it possible to deliver our binaries fast
and reliably to you :)
