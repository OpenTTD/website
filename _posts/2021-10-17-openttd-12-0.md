The time is finally here: 12.0 is officially released!

12.0 is our multiplayer update, where we made playing together as easy as possible.
No more port-forwarding or other stuff: start a server and ask your friend(s) to join.
We take care of the rest.
For more details, please read our blog: [New Multiplayer Experience](https://www.openttd.org/news/2021/09/26/new-multiplayer-experience.html)

Besides this major update, 12.0 also comes with some other nice features:
- Display icon/text whether vehicle is lost.
- Moving camera on title screen background.
- Hide block signals in GUI by default (you can toggle this in the settings).
- Raise the maximum NewGRF limit to 255.

To name just a few. And as always, we made sure to include tons (over 85!) of bug fixes in this release.

A special thanks goes out to our [translators](https://translator.openttd.org/): they translated the game in full for 29 (!) languages.

We hope you enjoy this new version, and make sure to try it out with a friend!
