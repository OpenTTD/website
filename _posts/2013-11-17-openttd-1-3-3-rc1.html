<p>Lo and behold, a new release of OpenTTD is ahead and as usual we start with a first release candidate for it. Here comes <a href=https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html>OpenTTD 1.3.3-RC1</a>.
</p><p>
This version took a bit longer than planned to be done, but it ships with a long list of fixes (see <a href=https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/1.3.3-RC1/changelog.txt>this changelog</a>). Most notably the handling
of text input and display, drawing and layout text strings got improved, and a lot of long-standing bugs in OSX got fixed.
</p><p>
This is a lot of things which were changed, thus it needs sound testing. Have fun playing (and testing) this new release candidate and please
<a href=http://bugs.openttd.org>tell us</a>, if you encounter any oddities or bugs.
</p><p>
Enjoy,<br>
Your OpenTTD team
