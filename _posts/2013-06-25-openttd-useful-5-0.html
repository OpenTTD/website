Today we updated <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful">openttd-useful.zip</a> to change a library to support Brahmic languages (e.g. Tamil and Thai). 
If you want to compile upcoming releases/nightlies/trunk you have to update.
<br/><br/>
If you do not compile OpenTTD yourself or you are not using Microsoft's compiler you will not be affected.
