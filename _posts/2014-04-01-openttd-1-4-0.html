Today is 1/4/14, and after 1+4 betas and 1 release candidate, we reach the 1st stable release of the 1.4 series...
ok, I missed some 4s and the "1+4" may have been too much of a stretch; but what does that matter if you get OpenTTD 1.4.0 ?!
<br/><br/>
Thanks to those who helped testing, you can find the new stable release on our <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-stable">download page</a>.
<br/><br/>
Enjoy building stuff!
