The first betas of the upcoming OpenTTD 1.1.0 have already been released and we're looking for a new title game.<br/>
As done successfully for the last major branch, the 1.0 series, we also hold a title game competition this year. The exact requirements on the map are laid out in the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=50587">thread in our forum</a> dedicated to the title game competition. In order to participate you simply add your title game suggestion to that thread. Possibly post for quick orientation a screenshot as the <a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~planetmaker/titlegame/">overall screenshot overview</a> cannot be updated daily. Deadline for submissions is February 14th - so join the competition for the nicest and best show-off map for the OpenTTD title game of the OpenTTD 1.1 series :-).
<br/><br/>
After submissions are closed, the general public (so also you!) may vote on the entries in two rounds: first round of votes will be held in order to select a few for a short list. The subsequent final round will choose among these finalists.
