Time for a new beta release for the upcoming 1.1 branch of OpenTTD. Most importantly the annoying bug which crashed OpenTTD under some conditions when building rails has been fixed as well as a number of other smaller issues. We also have two new features, one allows to log the activity via the admin port and the other allows all Estonians to play with the correct currency also as of tomorrow.

Have fun, happy testing, happy new year and as usual feed back is welcome, bugs go to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">our bug tracker</a>.
