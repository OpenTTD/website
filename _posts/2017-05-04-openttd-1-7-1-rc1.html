OpenTTD 1.7.1-RC1 brings you a fine selection of fixes.
In particular it should work better on newer versions of Windows.
<br/><br/>
Please help testing the release candidate, so it works on various platforms.
<br/><br/>
In other news, our April Fool's plan to remove ships was not well received.
So we reconsidered them, and now look into trains.
<br/><br/>
May the fourth be with you!
