Today we released OpenTTD 1.0.4. Nothing seriously was reported since the release candidate,
and as we are confident the testers did a good job, we are also confident that it is a nice release!
<br/><br/>
Note that there is a new translation available in the release: You can now also enjoy OpenTTD in Belarusian.
A good moment to thank all translators continuously maintaining and updating the translations.
<br/><br/>
