Dear Diary,
<br/><br/>
People are so mean to me today. Here I am in this beautiful rainy day sitting outside a German's house, waiting for more food which seems absent at the moment.
<br/><br/>
While we were eating, we faked the community in believing nothing was done. Nothing is less true. Ha-ha. How did we fool them. Not only we made 6 commits, we also released 1.0.2. Not to forget we cut this lovely r20000 cake, which planetmaker made, and it was lovely.
<br/><br/>
His hospitality is generous and we all seem to like being here.
<br/><br/>
With this, my dear diary, I would like to close up. I hope you enjoy 1.0.2, a new step forward to an even more stable version of the 1.0 branch.
<br/><br/>
Enjoy!
