<p>Didnâ€™t Santa give you the presents that you was longing for?
</p><p>
Well, we cannot help you with that, but here is the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">second beta</a> for the upcoming OpenTTD 1.4.0 release. Please give it some testing and report any bugs that you may encounter to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">bug tracker</a>. Especially worth testing might be our <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.0-beta2/changelog.txt">new blitters</a> which can give you a considerable speed gain on modern CPUs if you play with 32bpp graphics.
</p><p>
General questions are happily answered in our <a href="http://forum.openttd.org">forum</a> or on <a href="irc://irc.oftc.net/openttd">IRC</a>.
</p><p>
Translators (which might be you) might now find it a good idea to <a href="http://translator.openttd.org">review the translation</a> of this upcoming release for strings that need attention so that the release can be shipped fully translated to your language.<br>
We also like to remind you about the ongoing <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=69651">title game competition</a> which accepts submissions till 15th February 2014, 0:00:00h UTC.

Enjoy,<br>
Your OpenTTD Team
