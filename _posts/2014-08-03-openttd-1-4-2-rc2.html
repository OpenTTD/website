Despite the sunny summer weather (or perhaps thanks to the warm weather), several people found new bugs in the previous release candidate.
<br/><br/>
As highlights, ships used the wrong sound for a break down, and there was a sudden loss of tractive effort due to an overflow with trains. Also, Slovak number separator locale was fixed. The complete list of fixes can be found at the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.2-RC2/changelog.txt">Changelog</a>.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to all who found and reported these bugs. It helps in making OpenTTD a stable program that can be enjoyed for many years.
<br/><br/>
For further testing, we are happy to present a new <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">OpenTTD 1.4.2-RC2 version</a>. 
<br/><br/>
If you find any problems, please report them to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>.
