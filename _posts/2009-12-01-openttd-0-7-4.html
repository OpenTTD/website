Today we released a new bug fix release of OpenTTD's 0.7 series. Nothing world shattering but we did our best reducing the number of bugs.
<br/><br/>
Again we would like to mention the free graphics and sound replacement projects, respectively <a href="http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx">OpenGFX</a> and <a href="http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx">OpenSFX</a>. We really would like these projects to be finished, or at least have a complete set of graphics/sounds, before we start with our next stable series. 
<br/><br/>
We are also still looking for <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=45247">Mac OS X developers</a> who are willing to take over the Mac OS X port of OpenTTD.
