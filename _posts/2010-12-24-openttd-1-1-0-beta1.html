title: OpenTTD 1.1.0-beta1
author: planetmaker

It's time again, as a little Christmas present we present the first beta of 1.1.0. As usual you'll need a 
graphics base set which can either be the original TTD base set or OpenGFX. New things in this release 
include extended support for NewGRFs (especially NewObjects), an industry chain preview and much improved
handling in the GUI when loading games and configuring NewGRFs (including their parameters). There is also 
a new admin-interface which allows server control over another network port. Check out the whole list 
of changes in the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.1.0-beta1/changelog.txt">changelog</a>.
</p><p>
Also we recently started to provide binaries for Mac OS X again, thus this release is also
available for Mac users.
</p><p>
At the same time we'd like to encourage people to have a thorough
<a href="http://translator.openttd.org/en/status">look at the translation</a> into their 
preferred language. Now is a good time to get your language up to date for the upcoming 1.1.0 release. 
In order to register as translator you need an account with OpenTTD (e.g. the one you 
might already have for the wiki or the bug tracker) and notify the translation manager 
(see <a href="http://translator.openttd.org/en/faq">here</a> for details) of their desire to 
help with translations.
</p><p>
We would like to thank everyone who has made this release possible, happy testing :-) and a good holiday season to all of you.

Note: there is a crash bug with the "autorail" feature and the version for the Windows binaries is incorrect making it impossible for a Windows client to join a non-Windows server and vice versa. Both of these issues are fixed in the nightlies and will be fixed in 1.1.0-beta2.</p>
