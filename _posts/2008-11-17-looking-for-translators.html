title: Looking for translators
author: Rubidium

Over the course of this year we have added a few hundred new strings, however many languages have not translated these strings yet. Furthermore half a dozen new languages have been added, but most of them are not fully translated as of now.
<br /><br />
So effectively we are looking for dedicated players who like to help translating OpenTTD into one of the following languages: <ul>
<li>Esperanto</li>
<li>Frisian</li>
<li>Greek</li>
<li>Ido</li>
<li>Lithuanian</li>
<li>Luxembourgish</li>
<li>Macedonian</li>
<li>Malay</li>
<li>Persian</li>
<li>Serbian</li>
<li>Thai</li>
<li>Urdu</li>
<li>Any other language where OpenTTD is not translated in, see <a href="https://translator.openttd.org/">our statistics</a> for a list of translated languages.</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you are interested in translating OpenTTD you should send an email with the language you want to translate and the username + password you would like to use to login to {mailto:translator@openttd.org}.
