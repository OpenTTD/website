Today we present to you OpenTTD 1.2.0-RC3, which is hopefully the last release candidate before the stable release. (Depending on your location it will definitely be the last one this winter/summer :)
<br/><br/>
The main attraction of this release candidate is probably the new titlegame: Bluescreen's submission won the competition. Let's just hope it does not cause blue screens for you.
(Sorry, someone had to say, what everyone expected someone to say at some point.) Anyway, if you encounter some, then please report them to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a> :)
<br/><br/>
Now, go to the download section, get RC3, and have fun!
