Another year, another release.
Who would have guessed ;)

With 1.11 we bring you a lot of new features which you hopefully enjoy as much as we did creating them:
* Performance improvements - Fast-Forward is now so fast, there is a setting to rate limit it (on by default).
* Improved World Generation GUI - 100% rainforest maps are now available if you so request.
* Towns can now grow with tunnels too - finally they can escape the hills!
* Filter on name in many more windows - for those that enjoy playing with one too many NewGRFs.
* Plant trees with a brush - it is like painting, but with trees.
* A new titlegame for this release by Chrnan6710, who won this year's competition.
 
And that is not all.
We also fixed over 100 bugs and added / changed / improved over 100 more things.
As always, check the changelog for a detailed overview.

Owh, and we are also now available [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536610/OpenTTD/).

So, to stay in the spirit of the current world situation: if your friends ask you why you are not visiting, tell them it is because OpenTTD 1.11 just released ;)
