The 1.4.1-RC1 testing release still had a few bugs that were found due to your play-testing efforts.
Among them an issue for multi-head train refits at stations, and an old bug where cargo was not aging.
The entire list of changes can be found in the <a href="http://binaries.openttd.org/releases/1.4.1-RC2/changelog.txt">Changelog</a>.
<br/><br/>
As usual, please test the new <a href="http://www.openttd.org/download-testing">new 1.4.1-RC2 release</a>, and report any bugs that you find to the <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">FlySpray bug tracker</a>.
<br/><br/>
If all goes well, we should have a new stable release soon.

Your OpenTTD team
