While we are slowly working towards 1.12, we have an in-between-versions surprise for you guys:

OpenTTD is now also available on GOG.com!

A big thanks to the amazing people at GOG.com for helping us getting there; especially their QA team which not only identified problems, but also found a fix for it .. that is just awesome!

So, go give them a big hug, and check it out: [https://www.gog.com/game/openttd](https://www.gog.com/game/openttd).
