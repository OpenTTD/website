title: OpenTTD 1.1.0-beta3

The next beta for 1.1 is available. This first release in 2011 fixes again some bugs for further stabilising, but also adds a few features.
Most noticeable: Server admins can now define limits for terraforming, both to prevent vandalism as well as forcing the player to build with the landscape.

Please enjoy the new beta release, and report any issues spoiling the fun to our <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org">bug tracker</a>. You can find the download as usual on the top-left of this page.
