Are you spooked?
We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky.

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series.
We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release.

Some of the higlights of this release include:
* Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag.
* Wider rivers on map generation.
* Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens.
* Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window.
* Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions.

(As ever, see the changelog for further details).

The usual titlegame competition has been [announced on the forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=90357).
See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested.
