While OpenTTD 14 has been well received (just as we've recieved a lot of survey data), it has apparently also been occasionally out-of-sync with itself.

The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multi-player out-of-sync bug and smoothes a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature.
As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog.
