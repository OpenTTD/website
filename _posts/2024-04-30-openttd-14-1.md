Our players have played a lot of OpenTTD 14 since it was released a few weeks ago -- in last week alone those who opted into our [survey](https://www.openttd.org/news/2024/03/16/survey-https-infra) played 34,700 hours across 17,219 games.

In all those hours, you've found some bugs, and we've done our best to fix them.
The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multiplayer desync bug and cleans up a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature.
As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog.
