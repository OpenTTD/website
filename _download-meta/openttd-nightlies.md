For OpenTTD you can use the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files (you need to own a Transport Tycoon Deluxe CD).
There are also the free alternatives: [OpenGFX (graphics)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx), [OpenSFX (sound)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx), and [OpenMSX (music)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openmsx).
These can be installed automatically by the Windows and OS/2 installers.
Please refer to the [readme](https://binaries.openttd.org/nightlies/trunk/@@version@@/readme.txt) for more information.

You can download the free alternatives here: [download OpenGFX](../opengfx-releases/), [download OpenSFX](../opensfx-releases/), and [download OpenMSX](../openmsx-releases/).
