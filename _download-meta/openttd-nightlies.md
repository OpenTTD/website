OpenTTD requires a separate base graphics set to run, which can be downloaded on first run.
In case you want to manually download and install it, some options are:
* [OpenGFX (graphics)](../opengfx-releases/latest)
* The Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files can be used as base graphics set. You must own a version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe; they cannot be downloaded.

Sound and music sets are recommended (but not necessary).
* [OpenSFX (sound)](../opensfx-releases/latest) and [OpenMSX (music)](../openmsx-releases/latest) can be installed via the in-game content download manager.
* The Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files can be used as base sound / music set. You must own a version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe; they cannot be downloaded.

Additional graphics, sound, and music sets can be downloaded via the in-game content download manager.
