For OpenTTD you can use the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files (you need to own a Transport Tycoon Deluxe CD).
There are also the free alternatives: [OpenGFX (graphics)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx), [OpenSFX (sound)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx), and [OpenMSX (music)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openmsx).
These can be installed automatically by the Windows and OS/2 installers.
Please refer to the [readme](https://proxy.binaries.openttd.org/openttd-pullrequests/@@version@@/README.md) for more information.

You can download the free alternatives here: [download OpenGFX](../opengfx-releases/latest.html), [download OpenSFX](../opensfx-releases/latest.html), and [download OpenMSX](../openmsx-releases/latest.html).

**WARNING** - These binaries are built based on [Pull Request](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pulls); the quality might vary, as the Pull Request might not be merge-ready.
Savegames can be incompatible with other versions of OpenTTD and also with other versions of this Pull Request.
Please be careful, and don't use these binaries for long-term gameplay.
