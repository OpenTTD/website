This plugin enables OpenTTD's integration with GOG Galaxy. You need OpenTTD 14.0 or later.

For Linux / Windows, to install the plugin, extract the download into your `social_integration` folder under [your personal / shared directory](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/docs/directory_structure.md).
For MacOS, simply run the `Install`.

At any time, when OpenTTD is not running, you can remove the plugin from the `social_integration` folder to disable the integration.
