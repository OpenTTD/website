Allemont has seen a massive influx of tourists these last years seeking winter adventures. At least 2 new residential centres are being built at the moment and the end is still not in sight.
The local contractor, seeing opportunities, is hard at work to accommodate this expansion; just now a new bridge is being planned. The 'measurement tooltip' (Patches > Interface) shows accurate information for the tool. Advancement in technology has also made the 'build on steep slopes (double foundations)' feature possible, as seen below some of the tracks. It not only looks great, but is also environmentally friendly!
