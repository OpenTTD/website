A game from Darthrafael, who said

"I'm focused primarily on getting things to look nice, and have as such given myself lots of money, because I enjoy playing with trains,

Trainsets are:
- Iron Horse 2 (Main Trainset, it's really good)
- Dutch Trainset 2 (Might use some intercities and express trains from here, but I'm primarily focusing on Iron Horse)
- Vactrains 0.2.2 (Because I like the Generic Vactrains for the Future)
- DBSet XL (Again for express trains because fancy liveries)

Industry-wise I'm using ECS and the Lumber Camp sets. For buildings I use the UK Town Set, Town & Industry Houses, and Swedish Houses. I'm using NuTracks for tracks, but I also have Planning Tracks & Track Beds. I technically also have Pikka's Finescale Tracks, but they're enabled purely for the signals. I like the smaller signals it gives, and unfortunately I have no idea if there's a GRF out there that adds just the signals, because sometimes combining tracktypes gets a bit weird.

Oh, and to get my Locomotives to be in the shade of black that they are, I'm using the Mauve-to-Black GRF I found somewhere on here."
