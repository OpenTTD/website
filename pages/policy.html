            <h3>About Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser.
                They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").
            </p>
            <p>
                Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer.
                They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.

            <h3>Cookies on our Website</h3>
            <p>
                OpenTTD only uses session cookies, and only for the authenticated parts of some of our services (like our wiki, BaNaNaS, etc), so called "necessary cookies".
                These cookies are only set when you login to those services, and only restrict access to the authenticated part of those services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name of the cookie always starts with the name of the service (like "wiki" or "bananas") followed by "_sid".
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenTTD does not make use of any functional or any third party cookies.
