            <p>If you enjoy playing OpenTTD and would like to help support its development, please consider donating. OpenTTD is developed and released free of charge, and the developers give up their own free time to work on the game. In addition the server used to build the <a href="https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest.html">releases</a> and host the <a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/Community">web services</a> costs a lot of money to run, so any support would be appreciated.</p>
            <p>If you would like to support OpenTTD, donations can be made in a number of ways:</p>
            <ul class="section-list">

                        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> is the most common and perhaps the easiest way to make a donation.
